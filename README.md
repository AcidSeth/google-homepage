This is a mockup of the Google homepage, without having looked at its HTML or CSS. I've learned a lot about actually creating and placing elements, and how to keep things relatively tidy in CSS as well.
It's certainly not perfect, and I might have focused a bit too much on it looking visually similar, but it was a fun afternoon!
