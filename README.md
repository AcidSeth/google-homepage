This is a mockup of the Google homepage, without having dived into its HTML or CSS, or solutions from other projects. I've learned a lot about actually creating and placing elements, and how to keep things relatively tidy in CSS as well.
It's certainly not perfect, and I might have focused a bit too much on it looking visually similar, but it was a fun afternoon and a half!
